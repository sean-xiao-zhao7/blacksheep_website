            </p>
            <p>Communications (Messenger)</p>
            <p>BlackSheep has provided a secure messaging service for Members seeking to communicate with community leaders.

BlackSheep mentors may not respond to unencrypted e-mail from Members seeking advice or assistance. BlackSheep cannot guarantee the confidentiality of such unencrypted e-mail transmissions.
            </p>
            <p>No special relationship or obligation will result from the transmission of e-mail or electronic messaging generated outside the members-only area from Members to the BlackSheep for the purpose of seeking advice or assistance.

            </p>
            <p>If you wish to transmit sensitive information, documents or other materials through the BlackSheep App electronically, this should be done via the secure messaging service, and solely at your own risk. This service allows you to transmit such materials to the BlackSheep members for the purposes of communicating questions or seeking advise. You agree that you will not upload or transfer any files, documents or materials: (i) which are unlawful, abusive, defamatory or obscene including without limitation any such material constituting or encouraging conduct that would constitute a criminal offence, create civil liability or otherwise violate any local provincial, national or international law or regulation, or (ii) which knowingly contains a virus or other harmful component(s).
            </p>
            <p>You also agree that copies of all communication between you and community members using BlackSheep’s secure messaging service and copies of the files, documents and other materials that you forward using the BlackSheep App through the members-only area of the BlackSheep Website and/or App become the property of BlackSheep.

            <p>Last updated: January 2025</p>
            <p>
                1. Zero-Tolerance Policy for Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)</p><p>
                BlackSheep has a zero-tolerance policy toward Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE). The use of the BlackSheep app to create, upload, distribute, request, promote, store, or facilitate any form of CSAE is strictly prohibited.
                This includes, but is not limited to:</p><p>
                •	Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)</p><p>
                •	Sexualized content involving minors</p><p>
                •	Grooming, solicitation, or exploitation of minors</p><p>
                •	Any behavior intended to harm, exploit, or endanger a child</p><p>
                Any violation of this policy may result in immediate content removal, account suspension or termination, and referral to law enforcement where required.
            </p><br /><p>
                2. Scope and Applicability</p><p>
                These standards apply to all users, content, interactions, and activities on the BlackSheep platform, including user-generated content, messages, media uploads, and profile information.
                Use of the BlackSheep app constitutes agreement to comply with these standards.
            </p><br /><p>
                3. In-App Reporting & User Feedback Mechanism (Self-Certification)</p><p>
                BlackSheep provides an in-app mechanism that allows users to:</p><p>
                •	Report suspected CSAE or CSAM</p><p>
                •	Submit safety concerns or policy violations</p><p>
                •	Provide feedback related to child safety</p><p>
                Reports can be submitted directly within the app and are reviewed by BlackSheep’s safety and moderation team.
            </p><br /><p>
                4. Handling of CSAM and CSAE Content (Self-Certification)</p><p>
                Upon obtaining actual knowledge of CSAM or CSAE-related activity, BlackSheep will take appropriate and prompt action, which may include:</p><p>

                •	Suspension or termination of involved accounts</p><p>
                •	Preservation of relevant data where legally required</p><p>

                Actions are taken in accordance with these published standards and applicable laws.
            </p><br /><p>
                5. Compliance with Child Safety Laws & Mandatory Reporting (Self-Certification)</p><p>
                BlackSheep complies with all applicable child safety laws and regulations.</p><p>
                Where required by law, confirmed CSAM is reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) or the relevant regional authority. BlackSheep maintains internal processes to ensure lawful and timely reporting.
            </p><br /><p>
                6. Child Safety Point of Contact</p><p>

            </p><br /><p>
